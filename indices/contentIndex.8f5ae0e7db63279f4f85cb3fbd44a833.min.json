As i sit there in the dark I think about the type of opera I'd make, and it involves a story told in time jumps between the future and the recent past of AI, and quite possibly about conciousness.\nFor one act or set piece I imagine it has a giant screen arrangement suspended from the ceiling, a bit like the [[private/Transmediale notes#Unconscionable Maps|the works of Evan Roth]] and a lonley hacker \"plugged in\" through a funnel of cables.\nThematically (and musically) realted to [Deus Ex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game)), as one part is set in post hydro-wars carbon-wars of the near future.\nOther locations inlcude a slum near a pumping station in south east asia like [Lower Bicutan](https://goo.gl/maps/kHa1FhNfRT3f2d3u5)\nI need to watch more contemporary operas, and find whatever happened to that lady that worked at the royal opera house whom I met at Sussex.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-09T15:11:51.317457503Z","tags":null},"/private/Projects/Large/Creative-AI-report":{"title":"Creative AI report","content":"---\n\nSee [[private/Projects/Things I think we should do#Projects]] for more:\n\n![[private/Projects/Things I think we should do#Projects]]\n\nThis would need external funding, perhaps from a smaller start to scope it, e.g.\n\n¬£1.5-2k to scope it --\u003e departamental grant\n¬£10k to do a first edition --\u003e Turing/TAS money\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-09T15:11:51.317457503Z","tags":null},"/private/Projects/Large/Promptology":{"title":"Promptology","content":"---\n\nA coffee table book about vernacular AI art as it developed before/besides [DALLE2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and subsequent corporate takeover.\n\nThe idea is to have several large super striking images and their prompts printed in large format and high quality, accompanied by essays on text-2-image systems. I've been thinking about whether these prompts might be gotten from a specific group of people, or with a specific theme, but I now think a broader theme like possible futures might be better.\nAnd also possibly something we can get from  [[private/Projects/Things I think we should do| a \"prompetition\" organised by CAIL]]  \nWe ask people to send us their prompts and we select, render, and upscale them using CREATE. We offer some form of prize.\nI also thought about workshoping these images between artists and essay writers.","lastmodified":"2023-02-09T15:11:51.317457503Z","tags":null},"/private/Projects/Large/Synthetic-Media-and-Generative-Approaches-in-the-Humanities":{"title":"Synthetic Media and Generative Approaches in the Humanities","content":"---\n\nLarger project.

Possible options:\n- Creative AI module ‚Äï level 6, practice-based, in the flex curriculum, using [e-research](https://docs.er.kcl.ac.uk/CREATE/access/)/NMEs teaching support.
