>JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.

Has a [live editor](https://mermaid.live/) for non-programmers, and has [some tutorials](https://mermaid.js.org/config/Tutorials.html). Maybe relevant to students. Also has a jupyter integration. Interesting for #criticaltechnicalpractice 
Can use this to render some diagrams for my computational essay paper.
