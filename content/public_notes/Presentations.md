As academics we are expected to engage in a number of activities, including conducting original research and communicating our findings to different audiences, from our closest peers to the wider public. This usually involves writing in various forms, for example research papers, reports, books, etc. And we teach academic writing to our students as they train to become independent researchers themselves.

However, another way we are constantly communicating is by presenting, and this, I think, receives less attention. Perhaps is because presentations are not seen as valuable as written outputs for academic advancement (depending on the discipline of course), or maybe is just that I notice because in my past life in media and design presenting was much more important.

There is some pleasure in having to pay close attention and dig deep to be able to follow complex ideas, concepts that are outside of one's are of expertise, or work-in-progress research which is not yet fully articulated. And I grant that academic presentations are not as transactional as for example business presentations. I don't believe that one needs to be a great storyteller to be an excellent researcher, and in some fields narrative can be seen as anathema to evidence and facts. But in nay case, surely there's a lot a room for improvement in academic presentations!

For example, I have seen many presentations that open with a research question, which I guess makes total sense for researchers. I think this is a terrible idea. Why do we believe that audiences, however specialised, care about the questions we ask ourselves? Seems somewhat presumptuous to me. I am much more inclined to pay attention if the speaker opens with a statement that I can agree or disagree with, something that tells them something about the speaker by how they believe things are, e.g. "don't you just hate when you can't think of a word?"
