> Zeeschuimer is a browser extension that monitors internet traffic while you are browsing a social media site, and collects data about the items you see in a platform's web interface for later systematic analysis. Its target audience is researchers who wish to systematically study content on social media platforms that resist conventional scraping or API-based data collection.

This would definitely be of interest to some of my UX students as a way to integrate in their usability tests and cultural probes when analysing social media usage.
