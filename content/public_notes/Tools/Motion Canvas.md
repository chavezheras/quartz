Great for education, documentation, and reflection in #criticaltechnicalpractice Reminds me a bit of Flash action script, but #FOSS and nicer for rapid development and to comunicate abstract ideas precisely. Think of [Freya Holm√©r](https://www.youtube.com/@Acegikmo) videos or [Ms Coffee Beans](https://www.youtube.com/@AICoffeeBreak).
