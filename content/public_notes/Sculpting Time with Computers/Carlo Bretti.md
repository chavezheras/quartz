## About
I’m a first-year PhD candidate at the [Multimedia Analytics Lab](https://multix.io) of the University of Amsterdam under the supervision of [Nanne van Noord](https://nanne.github.io) and [Pascal Mettes](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/p.s.m.mettes/).

I’m currently conducting research on computer vision and deep learning for film production and analysis. Before starting at MultiX, I worked on automatic trailer generation at the [Video & Image Sense Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/). Prior to that, I wrote my thesis on zero-shot action recognition in videos using diverse sets of object-scene compositions, advised by Pascal Mettes.
