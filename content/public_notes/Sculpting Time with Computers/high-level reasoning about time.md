The [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/film|film]] cluster contributed by outlining the diversity of approaches and levels of analysis about time in moving images. Some of these include recognising and manipulating several representations of time in a global working space and using long-term memory, namely: 

- [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/cinematic time|motion time]]
- character time 
- narrative time
- film time
- lived time 
- [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/historical time|historical time]]

Character time and lived time, for example, are closely linked to the articulation of  [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/subjective time|subjective time]], also discussed during the ideation sessions.

Computational models were recognised to be very limited in their capacity to simulate or perform this kind of reasoning. However, during the workshop we considered the opportunities of some of these methods to contribute to our understanding of some of these higher-level representations.
