This includes recognising and manipulating several representations of time in a global working space and using long-term memory, namely: 

- [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/cinematic time|motion time]]
- character time 
- narrative time
- film time
- lived time 
- [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/historical time|historical time]]

Computational models were recognised to be very limited in their capacity to simulate or perform this kind of reasoning. However, during the workshop we considered the opportunities of computational methods to contribute to our understanding of some of these levels and representations.
