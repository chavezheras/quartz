[[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Nanne van Noord|Nanne van Noord]], [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Mila Oiva|Mila Oiva]] and myself got together to to present recent research and engage in conversation about recent advances at the intersection between cultural analytics, computational aesthetics, and machine learning. This was a public-facing event part of the the [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Sculpting Time With Computers|Sculpting Time With Computers workshop]], supported by the [Department of Digital Humanities](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh) and the [Digital Futures Institute](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/dfi) at King's College London.
