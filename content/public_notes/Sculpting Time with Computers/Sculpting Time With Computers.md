# Interdisciplinary Approaches to Computational Moving Images

This workshop brought together a group of researchers in the fields of digital and computational humanities, computer vision, film, digital preservation and archives, cultural history, and creative computing, to explore together emerging computational approaches to the study of time in moving images.

In this small net of notes, I document and summarise our workshop activities (and thanks to [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Pauline van Mourik Broekman|Pauline]] for sharing her comprehensive notes which helped me put everything together in one place). Follow the links below for organic navigation, or find here [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/List of all notes|a list of all notes]]. 

The work for this workshop was split over two days:

-  On [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/day one|day one]] we explored the modelling of moving images as computational artefacts, and discussed the opportunities and challenges of computational approaches to large collections of moving images. 

- Based on these discussions, on [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/day two|day two]] we tested some of our ideas in practice using King's CREATE HPC cluster, kindly supported by [James Graham](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/james-graham) and [Matt Penn](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/matt-penn) from the [e-Research team](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/facilities/e-research)at KCL.

[[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Participants|Participants]] include researchers from leading laboratories in Europe, including the Cultural Data Analytics Open Lab ([CUDAN](https://cudan.tlu.ee/)) at Tallinn University and the Cultural Analytics Lab ([CANAL](http://canal-lab.uva.nl/)) at the University of Amsterdam, as well as archives and digital preservation experts from public UK institutions such as the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/) and the [BFI](https://www2.bfi.org.uk/explore-film-tv/bfi-national-archive/about-bfi-national-archive/archive-teams/data-team). The workshop was hosted by the [Computational Humanities Research Group](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/computational-humanities-research-group) in the [Department of Digital Humanities](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh) at Kingâ€™s College London. And a big thanks to [King's Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ai) who kindly provided us with welcome packs, including totes, and notebooks.
