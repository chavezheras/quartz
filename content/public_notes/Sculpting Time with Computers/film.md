In the film cluster we had [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Belén Vidal|Belén Vidal]], [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Tom Brown|Tom Brown]], and [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Isadora Campregher|Isadora Campregher]].

They brought our attention issues of embodied spectatorship, including the difficulties of encoding [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/subjective time|subjective time]] and [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/high-level reasoning about time|high-level reasoning about time]], which are needed to understand complex representations such as age in film. It was interesting to me to see some of these limitations mirrored in the [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/computational|computational]] cluster discussion about units of analysis.
