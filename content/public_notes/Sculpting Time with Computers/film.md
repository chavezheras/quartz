In the film cluster we had [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Belén Vidal|Belén Vidal]], [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Tom Brown|Tom Brown]], and [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Isadora Campregher|Isadora Campregher]].

They brought our attention issues of embodied spectatorship, including the difficulties of encoding  [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/high-level reasoning about time|high-level reasoning about time]] and [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/subjective time|subjective time]], which are needed to understand complex representations such as age in film. These levels were seen as mostly inaccessible to existing computational methods, and easily mobilised by human viewers.

It was interesting to see some of these limitations having correspondences in the [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/computational|computational]] cluster discussion about units of analysis.
