## About
Assistant Professor in the [Multimedia Analytics](https://multix.io/) lab of the University of Amsterdam. Iâ€™m interested in improving Multimedia Analysis with and for Visual Culture.

Before this I was a Postdoc in [CREATE](https://www.create.humanities.uva.nl/) working to improve the Computer Vision capabilties of the [CLARIAH](https://clariah.nl/) infrastructure. This followed my first Postdoc position at the [ISIS group](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/isis/) in the [SEMIA](https://sensorymovingimagearchive.humanities.uva.nl/)project. In SEMIA I worked on techniques for exploring AV archives based on perceptual and sensory features.

### Background
I wrote my PhD thesis at Tilburg University on representation learning for artistic style, the digital version of which can be found [here](https://nanne.github.io/papers/thesis.pdf).
