## About
Mila Oiva is a cultural historian enthusiastic about identifying patterns of transnational circulation of knowledge and ideas in a long temporal perspective. Detecting the gaps, overflows, as well as geographical and social differences between the circulating information and perceptions reveal global interconnectednesses and differences. Mila explores circulation of knowledge through case studies focusing on circulation of pseudohistorical contents in Russian language internet in the 2000s and circulation of ideas and footage in Soviet newsreels after World War II. In her research, she analyses text, audio-visual and metadata using computational text, image and network analysis methods in interdisciplinary collaboration with other scholars.
