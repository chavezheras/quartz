Three main ideas were discussed to follow up on the work from this workshop, in order of scale:

- Submit a joint abstract to the CUDAN Open Lab conference in Tallinn, in December. Deadline for abstracts  [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Mila Oiva|Mila]] got the ball rolling with a first draft
- Seek ways to formalise the research network to strengthen collaboration through more of these meetings and workshops. I will look into options to do this.
- Develop a larger project proposal in partnership with one of the [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/collections|collections]] if there is an apetite for that.
