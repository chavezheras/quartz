Three main ideas were discussed to follow up on the work from this workshop, more or less in order of immediacy and scale:

- Submit a joint paper to the [CUDAN Cultural Analytics Conference](https://cudan.tlu.ee/conference/) in Tallinn, in December. [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Mila Oiva|Mila]], [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Nanne van Noord|Nanne]], and myself, are preparing an abstract based on the idea of "aesthetically sensitive methods" and the promising findings of the tests we ran on the collection of soviet newsreels during the second day. 
- Find ways to formalise the research network to strengthen our collaboration. The idea is to hold these meetings and workshops more regularly, allowing us to block some time for joint discussion and experimentation.
- Explore if there is an appetite to develop a larger project proposal in partnership with one of the [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/collections|collections]].
