As a public-facing part of the [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Sculpting Time With Computers|Sculpting Time With Computers workshop]], in this “meeting of the labs” event, [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Nanne van Noord|Nanne van Noord]], [[public_notes/Sculpting Time with Computers/Mila Oiva|Mila Oiva]] and myself got together to to present recent research and engage in conversation about recent advances at the intersection between cultural analytics, computational aesthetics, and machine learning.
