_Creanalytics_: a portmanteau of creative and analytic.
This idea came up when writing about the[[private/To do/Towards a Computational Video Essay | computational video essay]] ,largely in response to creative and analytic research methods coexisting under a unified computational framework.   In the case of deep learning, this could be seen as _generation_ through _prediction_, similar to the [analytic-synthetic distinction](https://www.williamcotton.com/articles/chatgpt-and-the-analytic-synthetic-distinction) which I found in this piece about [analytic augmentation in prompt engineering](https://github.com/williamcotton/empirical-philosophy/blob/main/articles/from-prompt-alchemy-to-prompt-engineering-an-introduction-to-analytic-agumentation.md).
I will grow this into a paper for NYU's Digital Theory Lab conference on LLMs this summer in Prague.
