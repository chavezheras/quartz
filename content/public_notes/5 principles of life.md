Some very high-level background about cell-biology for my talk on  [[public_notes/Cultural Metabolism and LLMs on wheels|Cultural Metabolism and LLMs on wheels]] at Prague earlier this year.

According to Paul Nurse:

1. Living things are bounded physical entities
2. The bounded entity is the chemical and informational machine
3. This chemical and informational machine has a hereditary system
	1. The system prefigures how the entity works
	2. But has in-built variability to respond to its environment ([epigenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics))
4. The entity can therefore evolve by natural selection
5. The living thing can have purpose of being better adapted to the life state it finds itself
