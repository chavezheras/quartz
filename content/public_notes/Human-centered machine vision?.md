From the _Click and Collect: Show Me Your Dataset_ event at Somerset House. See the  [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/sh_studios_/status/1626900453828005889?s=20). 

I presented ongoing research on [[public_notes/Creanalytics|Creanalytics]] forthcoming as an article in a special issue on _Critical Technical Practice_ in the journal [Convergence](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/con).

The recording is now available here:
