From the _Click and Collect: Show Me Your Dataset_ event at Somerset House. See the  [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/sh_studios_/status/1626900453828005889?s=20). I presented ongoing research on the [[private/To do/Towards a Computational Video Essay | Computational Supercut]], forthcoming as an article in a special issue on _Critical Technical Practice_ in the journal [Convergence](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/con).
I'll post the full recording here if/when it's available.
