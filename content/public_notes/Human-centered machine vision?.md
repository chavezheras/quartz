From the _Click and Collect: Show Me Your Dataset_ event at Somerset House. I was invited as part of a panel with [Charlotte Webb](https://www.feministinternet.com/) and [Kristina Pulejkova](https://kristinapulejkova.com/) to discuss human-centred design in relation to AI. 

I presented ongoing research on [[public_notes/Creanalytics|Creanalytics]] forthcoming as an article in a special issue on _Critical Technical Practice_ in the journal [Convergence](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/con):
