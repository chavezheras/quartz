In the film cluster we had [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/Bel√©n Vidal]], [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/Tom Brown]], and [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/Isadora Campregher]].
They brought our attention issues of embodied spectatorship, including the difficulties of encoding [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/subjective time]] and [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/high-level reasoning about time]], which are needed to understand complex representations such as age in film. It was interesting to me to see this discussion mirrored in the [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/computational|computational]] cluster discussion about units of analysis.
