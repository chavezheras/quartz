In this cluster are [[Jake Berger]], [[Stephen McConnachie]], who brought to the group their experience and knowledge working with archives and large collections of moving images, from an institutional perspective in the UK, and [[Mila Oiva]], from a research perspective analysing large collections of Soviet newsreels.

Two challenges they highlighted for us in terms of encoding cinematic time for computational analysis: 

- Encoding performative aspects of carrier technology, for production and exhibition. For example common rules of thumb to estimate the frame rate of a projectionist cranking a film reel by hand in early films, or high frame rate such as in some of Ang Lee's films. 
- Encoding relational historical categories, such as "Victorian" or "post-war", and non-linear categories, such as cyclical time "weekly".
