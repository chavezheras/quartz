Three main ideas were discussed to follow up on the work from this workshop:

- Submit a joint abstract to the CUDAN Open Lab conference in Tallinn, in December. [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/Mila Oiva|Mila]] got the ball rolling on this with a first draft.
- Seek ways to formalise the research network to strengthen collaboration through more of these meetings and workshops. 
- Develop a larger project proposal in partnership with one of the [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/collections|collections]].
