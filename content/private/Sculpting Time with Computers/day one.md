## 6 July

### Introduction session
After informal conversations during coffee, we got started with a general introduction, where I gave an overview of the workshop, including its format, aims and, a provisional definition of cinematic time.

As I was organising this workshop, there were two references I kept (not always consciously) coming back to:

- One is Mary Ann Doane's excellent book [_The Emergence of Cinematic Time_](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674007840), where she makes a case for cinema transforming the very idea of time, and specifically, "modern ideas about continuity and discontinuity, archivability, contingency and determinism, and temporal irreversibility." 

- The other is Andrei Tarkovsky's [_Sculpting Time_](https://utpress.utexas.edu/9780292776241/), where he argues for an aesthetics of rhythm: "The dominant, all-powerful factor of the film image is rhythm, expressing the course of time within the frame."

I am very glad that some of these themes emerged during discussion, but also that they were just a point of departure.

To kick things off, we had a first round of discussion in four disciplinary clusters: [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/film|film]], [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/computational|computational]], [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/collections|collections]], and [[design]]. 

### Ideation session one: exploration
Having laid out some of the challenges and opportunities from our cluster perspective, we mixed into working groups and got to work on a [[long list of ideas]]. This session was organised around the principle of fast iteration: collect as many ideas as possible, no matter how unfeasible, to have a large pool to work from.

### Ideation session two: refinement
From the long list, three ideas organically emerged as the ones participants were most interested in, so we organised these by types of time, one for each table: [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/historical time|historical time]], [[subjective time]], [[cinematic time]]. We remixed again into working groups, and went on to refine these three ideas by mapping some of the possible inputs and outputs relevant to each kind of time.
