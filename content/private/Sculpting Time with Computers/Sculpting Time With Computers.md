# Sculpting Time With Computers
## Interdisciplinary Approaches to Computational Moving Images

This workshop brought together a group of researchers in the fields of digital and computational humanities, computer vision, film, digital preservation and archives, cultural history, and creative computing, to explore together emerging computational approaches to the study of moving images.

Participants include researchers from leading laboratories in Europe, including the Cultural Data Analytics Open Lab ([CUDAN](https://cudan.tlu.ee/)) at Tallinn University and the Cultural Analytics Lab ([CANAL](http://canal-lab.uva.nl/)) at the University of Amsterdam, as well as archives and digital preservation experts from public UK institutions such as the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/) and the [BFI](https://www2.bfi.org.uk/explore-film-tv/bfi-national-archive/about-bfi-national-archive/archive-teams/data-team). The workshop was hosted by the [Computational Humanities Research Group](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/computational-humanities-research-group) in the Department of Digital Humanities at Kingâ€™s College London.

On [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/day one|day one]] we explored the modelling of moving images as computational artefacts, and discussed the opportunities and challenges of computational approaches to large collections of moving images. Based on these discussions, on [[private/Sculpting Time with Computers/day two]] we tested some of our ideas using in practice using King's  Computational Research, Engineering and Technology Environment (CREATE), kindly supported by the University's [e-Research team](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/facilities/e-research). 

In these net of notes, I document and summarise our workshop activities, as well as our ideas for future work and to strengthen our collaboration. Any comments, let me know.
