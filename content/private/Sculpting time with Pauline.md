# Themes

# Biases
- Disciplinary biases are tempered in group work
- People project different values to different inputs and outputs depending on their disciplines
- Force you to organise in a "production mode"
- Meeting of the archives: ten theses on the archive
- Paul Gerhardt BBC archives consultant

# Archives
- Attack of cultural institutions, state funding entities
- Political moment came through quite forcefully
- Issues of value and production of value
- Value for the tax payer, value for users, value for collection holders, and for state
- Use cases, generating value and keeping the public archive relevant
- Interface structures viewing: the default setting is "flow"
- Enforced flow: can't leave!
- starting on 2015, 8 year stream of what's been on TV, 20% has been subtitled. A stream, not a film: television

# Medium specificity
Ignoring medium specificity? video flatten medium specific conventions, but then we want to recover traces of these conventions using computational method.

- Mapping SohoNet with cultural geographers --> Joel Mckim
- Moving data around for VFX people pioneered data transfer and distributed models of work
- Huge BFI archive, including TV streams? --> Stephen
- Cyclical time, years, weeks, etc. --> Mila
- Acceptable levels of artifice, different, shouldn't be jarring to contemporary audiences, but not re-write history

# Production Technology
- Carrier tech matters a lot
- Cranking of the camera: a performance
- Load of rules of thumbs, implicit knowledge, tacit knowledge, not formalised conventions
- Contingent assemblages of knowledge

# Embodied aspects
- The cutting edge (2004) documentary --> Water Murch, choreographic editing. The Mobile archive; the mobile video editor, people in action
- People's working spaces and physical movement in space --> The physicality of virtual work
- Age as network: relational age vs duration age
- Performed age vs duration age --> film representation

# Skills and technical skills
-  Redeploying existing knowledges, embodied knowledges, the mediated computational.
- Programmed de-skilling via relentless upgrades and software as service

# Film
- "Firsts" both fetishised but also relevant as data for dating footage and the obsession with "epochs".
- How films flow? fast and slow, rhythm
- AI regulates flows never to be a space for pause out of consumption, move people forward
- Prosthetic memory, unsolicited cycles, or time travel: when you are reminded of past duration against your will
- Higher level reasoning: film space, story space, memory space, narrative space
- Units of analysis and of production: shots, pixels, films?
- Faint signals of value, strong signals of little value
- Subjective time: how characters experience time? How is this perception portrayed
- Timeless space, or repeating time, or out of time

# Epochs / eras
-  Epoch or era detector: victorian shots, post-war film, etc.
- Scripted / non scripted: does it make a difference in terms of time?

# Historical time
- Moments of transition
- Keyframes: frames over sequences for historical time

# Mood detector: fast and slow
- Commercial needs
- Genre generator, trailer generator, editing style transfer
- Shot boundary detector SBD


## Data
- Subtitles, audio description

## Methods
- Object detection
- Location detection
- Age detection
- Anachronism detector
- Shot reverse shot detector
- Distance between year of production and year of depiction
- Meaningful objects: mobile phones, top-hats, vehicles, tech, fashion, architecture
- Off-screen stuff


# People


# Events
Film on Film Festival --> Stephen

# Reading
There's something wrong on the internet --> James Bridle 
Thumbelina Media --> Michel Serres
