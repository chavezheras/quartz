# Sculpting Motion
## Computational Approaches to Understanding Cinematic Time

A two-day workshop about the future of computational moving image studies and how to live well with seeing machines.

The event brings together researchers from the Cultural Data Analytics Open Lab ([CUDAN](https://cudan.tlu.ee/)) in Tallinn University, and the Cultural Analytics Lab ([CANAL](http://canal-lab.uva.nl/about/)) at the University of Amsterdam, who will join colleagues at King’s College London to explore different approaches to modelling moving images computationally and from a humanities perspective.

Together we will ask if and how we can create computational models of moving images that are useful for humanities research. The goal is to discuss and actively experiment with different ways of encoding the flow of moving images _in time_: from shot lengths measurements to high-dimensional representations that could afford new perspectives on the constitution and analysis of cinematic time, by attempting to model concepts such as continuity editing.

The workshop is designed to enhance the activities of the recently formed [Computational Humanities Research group](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/computational-humanities-research-group) by expanding its network within the college, and internationally, through new links with other research labs and institutions. Specifically, the workshop contributes to two of the group’s research strands:

- **Critical technical practice and the calculation of meanings**: how can we critically research and computationally intervene in the calculation of meanings in language, images, and symbols? 
 
- **Synthetic media and generative approaches in computational humanities**: How to incorporate large general purpose computational models and the forms of synthetic media they produce as tools and objects of research in humanities computing? 

These strands feed into the [Centre for Digital Culture](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/cdc) and its mission to support critical inquiry with and about digital technologies across disciplines, in this case computational technologies and moving images, explored by a group of scholars in digital humanities, film, informatics, cultural history, computer vision, and digital art.

The workshop is broadly organised in a day of introductions and theory, and a second day of practical work and conclusions. We expect to have 5 external researchers, 5 colleagues from King’s, and publish an open invitation for up to 5 PhD students or early career researchers who want to participate.

The proposed programme is as follows:

**Day 1**
Workshop session 1 ― introductions and lighting presentations
Workshop session 2 ― general discussion
Evening lecture ― open to all

**Day 2**
Workshop session 3 ― practical modelling
Workshop session 4 ― practical modelling 
Workshop session 5 ― conclusions and future plans

We seek funding for the following specific purposes:

2 day support from a research software engineer / e-research specialist
2 nights accommodation for 2-3 researchers from CUDAN
2 nights accommodation for 1-2 researchers from CANAL / [Cultural AI](https://www.cultural-ai.nl/)
2 day catering (coffee and lunch) for ~15 participants
1 group dinner for ~15 participants
1 drinks reception after the public lecture for ~50 attendants
