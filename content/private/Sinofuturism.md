>Sinofuturism indicates the convergence between a rising China and the acceleration of the  
technological realm. In the 20th century, the term conjured a cyberpunk aesthetic: a dense  
urban landscape filled with street food stands and hacked high tech. In the 21st century, the  
connotation has shifted, as both the power of China and the immersive ubiquity of technology  
intensifies. Sinofuturism, now recalling the darkest side of the Futurists, has come to elicit a  
science fiction dystopia bound to the horrific fantasy of inescapable techno-authoritarian rule.  
Today, anxiety about China and the latest technology are indistinguishable. The yellow peril  
has evolved into an army of robotic drones. Sinophobia and technophobia have become one  
and the same. That which was once feared as an underdeveloped barbarian horde, breaks with  
the predictable, progressive advance of chronological history, haunting the future as a  
nightmare that must be opposed.
