## The Proxy Landscape in False Colour
Lecture by [Robert Gerard Pietrusko](https://www.design.upenn.edu/people/robert-gerard-pietrusko)

He talked about false colour aerial images, promoted by the US government through NASA. He discussed these images as instruments designed in the context of the cold war, to estimate agricultural yield by proxy, mapping several images taken in US cities to estimate agricultural yield in the USSR. This was used as a proxy for food security, and informed geopolitical startegy and US foreign policy. In never worked. Pietrusko shows how these images were given much more credit than they ought to have been given as measurements. he argues they were effective affectively more than scientifically.
[Can one accurately estimate crop health from aerial imging?](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63977-6.00018-3)

I found the lecture well-prepared and delivered. I also liked the music, which he said he does himself. I think my lectures should have a soundscape. Perhaps using the technique of reading pixel values from images in Audacity that Rodrigo Faustini dos Santos used for his talk. Can even give rhythm and tempo depending on the presentation structure or even better live! adjusting to a speaker or with speaker cues.

## Real Time, Dead Time
Lecture by [Tung-Hui Hu](https://www.tunghui.hu/about)

Not as interesting as I expected it. I found his flippant style a bit annoying. Some clever one liners here and there, but a lot of posturing and too many jokes for my taste. His examples were also unconvicing. Saves me from reading the book though.

## Unconscionable Maps
Ayoung Kim 
[Evan Roth](http://www.evan-roth.com) 
[Suzanne Treister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Treister)

**Triester** was the most interesting of the three, she presented her work: [Scientific Dreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Treister)

>...a project which attempts to open and expand the unconscious imagination of scientists in order to envisage positive futures based on hypothetical scientific breakthoughs and their potential outcomes for this world and beyond, whilst exposing potential risks attached to related technological advances.

Consists on a series of diagrams made in a workshop where she askes scientists from CERN to imagine scientific breakthroughs and their consequences. These were then worked into a series of short stories which will be published in a book celebrating 10 years of Arts at CERN.

![Summative diagrams from the diagrams produced by the CERN scientists](http://www.suzannetreister.net/ScientificDreaming/Images/Diagrams/CERNSCIFI_SciBreakthroughs.jpg)

I can use this with my UX/design students of [[private/Teaching/7AAVDM57|7AAVDM57]] as scenarios for their projects, and specualtive fiction as a desing method.
This is also a good example of how to run a workshop where a specific community of people come up with stories for [[private/Projects/Large/Promptology|Promtology]].
I also think it would be a cool mini project to have these diagrams reworked using marmaid.

**Roth** is a much simpler techno dude. He does multi-screen compositions with various themes. Reminded me of the style I pictured for my [[private/Projects/Large/AI opera]]:

![Landscape with a ruin by Roth](http://www.evan-roth.com/photos/data/vothiii/installation-views/web/Landscape%20with%20a%20Ruin%20-%20voyez-vous%20(vinciane%20lebrun-verguethen)%20-9783-landscape.jpg)

![Image ruin 2](http://www.evan-roth.com/photos/data/vothiii/installation-views/web/Landscape%20with%20a%20Ruin%20-%20voyez-vous%20(vinciane%20lebrun-verguethen)%20-9860.jpg)

![Image ruin 3](http://www.evan-roth.com/photos/data/vothiii/installation-views/web/_J6A6265.JPG)

He also has this other project that's not in his website and I can't remember the name about warping images to map projections. Thought it would good to show as an example to students.

And finally Kin, the lest interesting of the three, presented some diatribe and a sketch of a film about gig workers. But made me think about delivery workers as a great example of a user group that is rarely designed for and can be used for my UX module.

## Home Invasion
(screening)

[Graeme Arnfield](https://www.graemearnfield.com/)

>Graeme Arnfield’s Home Invasion explores the development of Amazon’s smart doorbell - Ring. Installed and enabled by its customers, Amazon’s Ring represents the largest surveillance network in the world, broadcasting live images and audio from the front porches and doorways of millions of homes.

Interesting found-footage-style expressive documentary about the history of the "Ring" doorbell. It would be great to set as a required watch for students in design modules. #teaching 

It would also be a nice idea for a joint screening between Films Studies and DDH! #projects

## Imagine an overheated debate

Florian A. Schmidt, Sebastian Schmieg (although only one of them showed up and I'm not sure who)

A quick romp thoguh the recent history and debates of #AIArt online from the point of view of a graphic designer. Asks some very basic questions:

- What design skills are needed now that we can summon images at will?
- Do we need drawing and other classical representational skills of yore?

Should we forego drawing/writing becasue the "product" of it can be achieved by prompting. Like takng a shortcut? But drawing was not really taught only to produce nice images, but as a methodology to observe, a technique of the observer to invoke Crary. If we give up observation are we not loosing arguably a key dimension of drawing? stripped from this dimension, prompting ammounts to description. 
Drawing/writing is not only a mode of expression but of analysis, and documentation. Reminds me of the functions of documentary film by Nichols.

A historiography of AI Art online #project --> community detection + digital ethnography + in-depth interviews #methods

## Synthetic Images

McKenzie Wark
I tried. managed to stay for a while, but can't stand these unorganised panels and the expectation that personality amounts to intellectual content.

## An engine not a camera

[Orit Halpern](https://orithalpern.net/) is Chair of Digital Cultures and Societal Change at Technische Universität Dresden. Her work bridges the histories of science, computing, and cybernetics with design.

Milton Friedman is often paraphrased as saying that models don’t represent markets, they make them. A model, after all, is an operative machine, and even more so in the digital age.

Eloquent presenter. She makes a convincing link between the sofistication of financial instruments, i.e. derivatives and various other complex bundled bets of future stock prices, and the rise of global networked computation, and its key role in financialisation of markets. Subjects cannot know how the value of the financial asset they own maps to actual material value. The stick title does not represent value it generates it through its existence; the noise becomes its own form of signal.

This idea I find interesting, that models "shape" knowledge. It's the complementary move to data science that attempts to find a signal among noise. By contrast, shaping injects noise as thereby creating the signal. What the practicioner does is control the noise. This is a different way of controlling the epistemic horizon, assuming the signal is not known before hand, and only by adding noise can it be made to emerge.

This technique can be thought of as a method of #generativeHumanities linked to other #methods like agent-based modelling, simulation, randomisation, and visualisation. Like Conway's game of life, can there be a "game of culture"? 

#teaching idea: a L7 module on complexity, complex topics, generative methods, advanced computational methods in humanities computing, generative methods in humanities computing. Model-based methods in humanities computing.

## How Water Calculates

AM Kanngieser, Antonia Hernández, Laura Cugusi, Yu Hsin Su

I thought this was going to be about water calculators, or how to caclulate with water.
But it wasn't.
