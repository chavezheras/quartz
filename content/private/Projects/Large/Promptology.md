A coffee table book about vernacular AI art as it developed before/besides [DALLE2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and subsequent corporate takeover.

The idea is to have several large super striking images and their prompts printed in large format and high quality, accompanied by essays on text-2-image systems. I've been thinking about whether these prompts might be gotten from a specific group of people, or with a specific theme, but I now think a broader theme like possible futures might be better.
And also possibly something we can get from  [[private/Projects/Things I think we should do| a "prompetition" organised by CAIL]]  
We ask people to send us their prompts and we select, render, and upscale them using CREATE. We offer some form of prize.
I also thought about workshoping these images between artists and essay writers.
