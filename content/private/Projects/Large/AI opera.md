I've been going to the opera recently, and it is really great. As i sit there in the dark I think about the type of opera I'd make, and it involves a story told in time jumps between the future and the recent past of AI, and quite possibly about conciousness.
For one act or set piece I imagine it has a giant screen arrangement suspended from the ceiling, a bit like the [[private/Transmediale notes#Unconscionable Maps|the works of Evan Roth]] and a lonley hacker "plugged in" through a funnel of cables.
Thematically (and musically) realted to [Deus Ex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game)), as one part is set in post hydro-wars carbon-wars of the near future.
Other locations inlcude a slum near a pumping station in south east asia like [Lower Bicutan](https://goo.gl/maps/kHa1FhNfRT3f2d3u5)
I need to watch more contemporary operas, and find whatever happened to that lady that worked at the royal opera house whom I met at Sussex.
