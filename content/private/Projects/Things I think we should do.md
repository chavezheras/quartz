Give substance to some of the weaker claims of the position paper.

## Education
Since we (at KCL) are actually a large teaching operation, and CAIL now has critical mass of permanent members of staff, we should consider specific training/education initiatives that fit our activities. Possible options:
- Creative AI module ― level 6, practice-based, in the flex curriculum, using [e-research](https://docs.er.kcl.ac.uk/CREATE/access/)/NMEs teaching support. Possibly with invited lecturers each week? Could this be interesting to artists (Serpentine)?
- Summer workshop ― once a year, sprint-like, theme-based, artists (Serpentine), academics, students, and engineers.
- Student curating ― students find and curate AI Art advised by CAIL
- Creative AI competition

## Projects
- Book sprint with Meson Press? ―Mercedes
- [[private/Projects/Large/Creative AI report|Creative AI report]] Survey of the field leveraging research expertise form colleagues in the department, and Serpentine could broker access to the artists for interviews, etc. Maybe can be updated every year? ref. [Oxford report](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/news-events/reports/ai-the-arts/). <--are we not much better positioned to do this type of thing?
