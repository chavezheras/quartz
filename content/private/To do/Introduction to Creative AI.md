# Introduction to Creative AI

## Course description
 
> AI technologies enable new ways of analysing and producing media, including text, images, sound and video. Synthetic media produced through machine learning techniques is reshaping creative labour, and how we think about authorship, copyright, and aesthetic value more generally. This course is a critical-technical introduction to the field of Creative AI. The focus is on practical experimentation grounded in theory; students will learn about the history and theoretical foundations of generative AI technologies, explore how artists, designers and curators use them in their practices, and gain the technical skills to design and develop their own experimental pieces.
> 
> The course is structured sequentially, covering techniques of increasing complexity each week. Students will gain practical experience using pre-trained models for text, image, and sound generation, but will also develop advanced understanding of experimental encoding practices, learning the basics of high-performance computing by curating their own datasets and training their own models using open source tools and King's Computational Research, Engineering and Technology Environment (CREATE). Coding materials are in the Python programming language. 


## Prerequisites
No previous experience with machine learning is needed, but some familiarity with common programming principles (variables, loops, functions, etc) may be helpful.


## Learning objectives
On successful completion of this course, students will develop:

- A systematic understanding of synthetic media, its applications and implications in creative domains
- The critical skills to place creative AI practices in their broader cultural contexts
- The technical skills to use current systems and design their own creative AI projects

## Course structure
- 8x weekly lecturesÂ (1hr)
- 4x bi-weekly practical workshops (2hrs)

## Assessment
- e-portfolio 60%
- presentation 40%

## Delivery options
This course can be run as a face-to-face module, with live lectures and workshops, where students get to work in group mini-projects and have access to King's compute cluster. And in parallel, as an online course, with recorded video lectures and tutorials, a freely available compute environment, and remote support.
