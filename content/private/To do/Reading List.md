- [ ] [Field-level differences in paper and author characteristics across all fields of science in Web of Science, 2000–2020](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00246)
I want to know from this how digital humanities fare compared to traditional arts and humanities

>Abstract

With increasing availability of near-complete, structured bibliographical data, the past decade has seen a rise in large-scale bibliometric studies attempting to find universal truths about the scientific communication system. However, in the search for universality, fundamental differences in knowledge production modes and the consequences for bibliometric assessment are sometimes overlooked. This article provides an overview of article and author characteristics at the level of the OECD minor and major fields of science classifications. The analysis relies on data from the full Web of Science in the period 2000–2020. The characteristics include document type, median reference age, reference list length, database coverage, article length, co-authorship, author sequence ordering, author gender, seniority, and productivity. The article reports a descriptive overview of these characteristics combined with a principal component analysis of the variance across fields. The results show that some clusters of fields allow inter-field comparisons, and assumptions about the importance of author sequence ordering, while other fields do not. The analysis shows that major OECD groups do not reflect bibliometrically relevant field differences, and that a reclustering offers a better grouping.



- [ ] [Deepfakes and the Epistemic Apocalypse](https://philpapers.org/archive/HABDAT-2.pdf)

>Abstract:
>It is widely thought that deepfake videos are a significant and unprecedented threat to
our epistemic practices. In some writing about deepfakes, manipulated videos appear as the
harbingers of an unprecedented
epistemic apocalypse. In this paper I want to take a critical
look at some of the more catastrophic predictions about deepfake videos. I will argue for
three claims: 1) that once we recognise the role of social norms in the epistemology of
recordings, deepfakes are much less concerning, 2) that the history of photographic
manipulation reveals some important precedents for deepfakes which correct claims about
the novelty of deepfakes, and 3) that proposed solutions to deepfakes have been overly
focused on technological interventions. My overall goal is not so much to argue that
deepfakes are not a problem, but to argue that behind concerns around deepfakes lie a
more general class of social problems about the organisation of our social practices.
