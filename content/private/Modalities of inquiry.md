- A world of objects: technical,  engineering,  systematic, universal
- A world of subjects: human, subjective, empathetic, diverse

> [. . .] from  the  perspective  of  a  systems  engineer,  is  the  'man-machine  interface'  â€•  the  technical  specification  of  the  ways  in  which  a  user  will  observe,  control  or  feed  information  to  the  product.  A  second  mode  of  engagement  with  human  concerns  is  the  design  process  of  'requirements  capture',  where  a  complex  human  context  must  be  reduced  to  a  finite  set  of  defined  'features' that  should  be  implemented  in  the  eventual  product.
