Welcome to my public notes. Not quite a blog, but not a timeline either, this kind of personal wiki of linked notes is an attempt to gradually move away from social media platforms but still keep some kind of connection with the public internet. It is very close to the idea of a digital garden, in that it takes inspiration from the early web; from hypertext and the memex, and and from owning the files one shares. In keeping with these ideas, the notes in this garden are never fully finished and are meant to grow (or wither) organically. Read A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden, and The Garden and the Stream to know more about digital gardens.
